    <h2>Background Information</h2>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    Four nations exist on [landmass name]. Well, 3 actually, since [atlantis expy] is underwater. Those nations are Bruktosilvia, Guinisly, and Mirdia.
    There is an old legend that 3 brothers founded each nation based on their strengths. The youngest brother, known for his brute strength founded Bruktosilvia, a nation devoted to agriculture and mining. The second brother, known for his intelligence and ambition, founded Guinisly, a nation based on capitalism and technology. The eldest brother created his own isolated nation of Mirdia dedicated to the study of magic.
    For a time, they lived in peace. Eventually, tensions grew between Bruktosilvia and Guinisly. Because of the higher-level technology employed Guinisly, the people of Bruktosilvia were conquered. After decades of exploitation, the abundant farms of Bruktosilvia were turned into a wasteland by Guinislian leaders who overtaxed the land and used it as a hazardous waste dump.

    <h3 id="bh3">Protagonists</h3>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    <div><strong>Len</strong></div>
    <div>The brains of the team. He is incredibly frail due to a disease contracted in his infancy. To make up for this, he had tried to prove his worth by going into the mines. After hours of exploration, Len found a small underground workshop containing shards of a strange glowing crystal and the remains of a long dead mage. However, every competent mage wards his workshop, and taking a crystal shard had triggered magic wards.  The security measures caused a cave in that resulted in him losing both his arm and his beloved dog, though he escaped with the shard. </div>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    <div><strong>Amadeus Hessan</strong></div>
    <div>An exiled mage who seeks to prove his heritage. He's really an easy going guy, if a bit cocky. NOTE: Don't let him cook, he burns water.</div>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    <div><strong>Francis Arduin (Bobert)</strong></div>
    <div>An eccentric mage with a progress tracking ability. He’s also the mad scientist (well, he's actually an alchemist but "mad alchemist" doesn't sound as nice) and comic relief of the team. Francis actually comes from a lesser branch of the Anhalt (a magus family that specializes in biological manipulation), though he has taken on the name Bobert recently. Why? The Knoen Inquisition is looking for Francis Arduin, not Bobert. </div>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    <div><strong>Cog</strong></div>
    <div>That guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a girl who knows a person that can get you the stuff you need. Bobert's best friend and his voice of reason. He’s probably the reason why Bobert hasn’t started the apocalypse (yet).</div>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    <div><strong>Eliza</strong></div>
    <div>A former member of the revolution. She left because her partner Tiffany was resorting to extreme measures( like allying with a bandit group that routinely terrorizes and raids your nation. What are you even doing, Tiffany?). Has a scar on her neck that damaged her larynx. Though determined, she often runs from her problems…. like literally, she stole an experimental engine that allows her to build up kinetic energy while running to boost her speed to where she becomes a blue streak, and can stop to release the energy as a large blast.</div>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    <div><strong>K9</strong></div>
    <div>Len's robot dog. There's always a dog in the party.</div>
    <div><strong>Sila Willinfer</strong></div>
    <div>A member of the wealthy Guinislian elite, Sila is trained in swordplay, economics, and all the formal stuff you’d expect from nobility. This also has the unfortunate side effect of turning her into a rich spoiled brat. Cares little about those that live horribly in the wastelands. Publicly dating business associate Sebastian Villeneuve for public business advantages. As little as she cares for others, and wants her easy going life to continue, even she has some moral lines she won’t cross</div>

    <h3 id="rh3">Antagonists</h3>
    <div><strong>Alia Hessan</strong></div>
    <div>Amadeus’ adopted sister. Currently hunting him down for (allegedly) using dark magic. She has enlisted a scout group of Ravagers to help her for pay and become their leader.</div>
    <div><img src="dave.png"></div>
    <div><strong>Dave Ravager</strong></div>
    <div>Leader of the Ravager clan in the Wasteland of Bruktoslivia. He is widely known for his ruthlessness, efficiency and his extremely short height of [User has been silenced. Dave Ravager sends his regards]. He also loves his daughter Lilac very much.</div>
    <div><strong>Hans Sharkface</strong></div>
    <div>A major player in the Wasteland, "Sharkface" Hans is a vicious man prone to raiding and terrorizing settlements to prove his superiority. His immense strength and success has united half the bandit tribes under the banner of the Sharkface clan. He has a chaingun arm lovingly named Svetlana. Many have speculated to his past, and how he got his ungodly strength and resistance, few ask him and live to tell the tale.</div>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    <div><strong>Tiffany</strong></div>
    <div>Insists on being called Tif. Ex boyfriend of Eliza. A revolutionary allied with Sharkface, he aims to prevent Sebastien's conspiracy against the corporate oligarchy of Guinisly. His cybernetics and specialization in electronic warfare made him a serious threat to both the Guinislian oligarchy and Sebastien's plans. He has the right motives of stopping Sebastien, but will stop at nothing, including total anarchy. Fun Fact: He got that name when he lost a poker game (and this is why you don't play with high stakes). His birth name is Andrew Bevan.</div>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    <div><strong>Sebastien Villeneuve</strong></div>
    <div>An upstart entrepreneur and inventor from some isolated corner of western Guinisly. He’s planning to become the future dictator of Guinisly with plans for an abrupt and bloody rise to power (VIVA LA REVOLUTION!). Known for his charisma, intelligence, and absolutely killer fashion sense. In the public eye though, he is only seen as a cute up and coming entrepreneur making business dealings with the Willinfer Corporation and dating Hill Willinfer’s daughter, Sila.</div>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    <div><strong>Knoen</strong></div>
    <div>Grandmaster of the Magistrate. He is seen as the benevolent and efficient leader of Mirdia and greatly respected by the people. However, he is secretly a cruel and hypocritical dictator that utterly crushes and censors any possible threats to his power, whether external or internal. (Really, with the amount of bloodlines he's exterminated, he should have been overthrown by now. This guy's PR team is <em>good</em>.)</div>
