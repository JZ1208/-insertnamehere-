    <h2>Background Information</h2>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    There are 4 nations on [landmass name]. Well, 3 actually, since [atlantis expy] is underwater. Those nations are the Wasteland, [tech world], and [magic world].
    There is an old legend that 3 brothers founded each nation based on their strengths. The youngest brother, known for his brute strength founded the Green, a nation devoted to agriculture and mining. The second brother, known for his intelligence and ambition, founded [tech world], a nation based on capitalism and technology. The eldest brother created his own isolated nation dedicated to the study of magic.

    <h3 id="bh3">Protagonists</h3>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    <div><strong>Len</strong></div>
    <div>The brains of the team. He is incredibly frail due to a disease contracted in his infancy. To make up for this, he had tried to prove his worth by going into the mines. After hours of exploration, Len found a small underground workshop containing shards of a strange glowing crystal and the remains of a long dead mage. However, every competent mage wards his workshop, and taking a crystal shard had triggered magic wards.  The security measures caused a cave in that resulted in him losing both his arm and his beloved dog, though he escaped with the shard. </div>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    <div><strong>Amadeus</strong></div>
    <div>An exiled mage who seeks to prove his heritage. He's really an easy going guy, if a bit cocky. NOTE: Don't let him cook, he burns water.</div>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    <div><strong>Bobert</strong></div>
    <div>An eccentric mage with a progress tracking ability. Also the mad scientist (well, he's actually an alchemist but "mad alchemist" doesn't sound as nice) and comic relief of the team. </div>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    <div><strong>Cog</strong></div>
    <div>That guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a girl who knows a person that can get you the stuff you need. Bobert's best friend and his voice of reason.</div>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    <div><strong>Eliza</strong></div>
    <div>A former member of the revolution. She left because her partner Tiffany was resorting to extreme measures( like allying with a bandit group that routinely terrorizes and raids your nation. What are you even doing, Tiffany?). Has a scar on her neck that damaged her larynx. </div>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    <div><strong>K9</strong></div>
    <div>Len's robot dog. There's always a dog in the party.</div>

    <a name="antag"></a>
    <h3 id="rh3">Antagonists</h3>
    <div><img src="dave.png"></div>
    <div><strong>Dave</strong></div>
    Leader of the Ravager clan in the Wasteland. He is widely known for his code of honor, strict policies, and his flying ship.</div>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    <div><strong>Hans</strong></div>
    <div>A major player in the Wasteland, "Sharkface" Hans is a vicious man prone to raiding and terrorizing settlements to prove his superiority. His immense strength and success has united half the bandit tribes under the banner of the Sharkface clan.</div>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    <div><strong>Tiffany</strong></div>
    <div>Insists on being called Tif. A revolutionary allied with Sharkface, he aims to prevent Sebastien's conspiracy against the oligarchy. His cybernetics and specialization in electronical warfare made him a serious threat to both [tech world] and Sebastien's plans. Fun Fact: He got that name when he lost a poker game (and this is why you don't play with high stakes). His birth name is Andrew.</div>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    <div><strong>Sebastien Villeneuve</strong></div>
    <div>Current dictator of [insert name for tech world]. Known for his abrupt and bloody rise to power, he is greatly feared among his people(mostly the members of the former ruling class rather than the civilians, since he publicly executed the former chairman)</div>
    <div><img src=""></div>
    <div><strong>Khown</strong></div>
    <div>Grandmaster of the Magistrate. He is seen as the benevolent and efficient leader of [magic world name] and greatly respected by the people. However, he is secretly a cruel and hypocritical dictator that utterly crushes and censors any possible threats to his power, whether external or internal. (Really, with the amount of bloodlines he's exterminated, he should have been overthrown by now. This guy's PR team is <em>good</em>.)</div>
